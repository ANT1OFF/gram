# Running Gram behind another service

[Up: Docker](DOCKER.md#hosted-features)

A Gram server can run as one part of a larger deployment: self-hosted for a team, or inside a
platform that brings its own sign-in, scheduling and storage. This page covers the seams such a
deployment configures. Every one of them is inert until **Hosted features** is on
([Docker](DOCKER.md#hosted-features)); with it off the server behaves as the desktop app's own,
whatever its environment says.

The seams are configured from the server's environment, never from settings, and a malformed
value stops the server at start rather than half-configuring it.

| Variable               | What it sets                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GRAM_EMBED_TOKEN`     | The bearer token the platform's services send on `/embed/v1/*`                 |
| `GRAM_REPO_EVENTS`     | `pushed`: repository events arrive on `/embed/v1/repo-events`; needs the token |
| `GRAM_SCHEDULER_URL`   | Where wakes, snoozes and routine runs are registered; needs the token          |
| `GRAM_SCHEDULER_TOKEN` | The bearer token sent to the scheduler                                         |

Tokens are at least 32 characters with no whitespace. The server takes them out of its own
environment once it has read them, so no agent, terminal or `git` process it starts inherits one.

## Calls into the server

The platform's own services call the server under `/embed/v1/`. These paths exist only while
Hosted features is on and `GRAM_EMBED_TOKEN` is set; otherwise a request to one is answered as a
request to any path the server doesn't have.

A caller proves itself with `Authorization: Bearer <GRAM_EMBED_TOKEN>` and nothing else. No cookie
stands in for the token, a request carrying an `Origin` header is refused whatever its token, and
the token opens no other path. These calls are let past the loopback `Host` check, since a service
reaches the server by its address inside the deployment: keep the server's port off any network a
browser or an untrusted workload can reach. Bodies are JSON objects of at most 256 KB.

| Status | Meaning                                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Done; the body says what was done                        |
| `400`  | The body isn't what the path takes; `error` says what is |
| `401`  | No bearer token, or not the configured one               |
| `403`  | The request carried an `Origin`                          |
| `404`  | No such path under `/embed/v1/`                          |
| `405`  | The path doesn't take that method                        |
| `413`  | The body is over 256 KB                                  |

## Pushed repository events

By default the server asks GitHub about each open thread's pull request on a timer. With
`GRAM_REPO_EVENTS=pushed` it stops: whoever receives the repository's webhooks tells the server
what changed, and the server reads that pull request then.

```http
POST /embed/v1/repo-events
Authorization: Bearer <GRAM_EMBED_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "events": [ { "repo": "acme/web", "number": 12, "branch": "feat/x", "kind": "check" } ] }
```

- `repo` is `owner/name`. `number` is the pull request and `branch` its head branch; both are
  optional. Send `branch` for a pull request that was just opened, which its checkout knows only by
  its branch. An event naming neither is about every checkout of the repository.
- `kind` is one of `pull_request`, `check`, `review` and `comment`. It is optional and changes
  nothing: the read shows whatever changed.
- A call carries 1 to 200 events and answers `{ "accepted": <events>, "checkouts": <read> }`.

An event carries no state. It names what changed and the server reads it from GitHub as it reads
everything else, so a stale or mistaken event costs one read and shows nothing untrue. Events for
one checkout within a second are one read, reads of one checkout are at least five seconds apart,
and no read is made while GitHub is rate limiting the server. Without `GRAM_REPO_EVENTS=pushed`
the path answers `409`. An event touches a checkout when it names the pull
request the checkout shows, its branch, or a pull request one of its threads is bound to, follows
or has a wake on.

What changes while events are pushed:

- The background sweeps leave GitHub alone, apart from one read per checkout every 20 minutes as
  the fallback for an event that never arrived.
- A person opening a thread, and any action that needs a fresh answer (a merge, a rerun), still
  read at once.
- Watched workflow runs (`run_monitor`), review requests and event routines keep their own timers.

## An outside scheduler

A wake an agent set, a snooze and a routine's next run each wait for a time. The server waits in
its own process, which is enough while it runs. A server that is stopped while idle fires nothing,
so with `GRAM_SCHEDULER_URL` set each wait is also registered with the deployment's scheduler,
which starts the server if it has to and calls back when the time comes.

The server tells the scheduler a key and a time, and nothing of what the wait is for:

```http
PUT <GRAM_SCHEDULER_URL>/timers/<key>
Authorization: Bearer <GRAM_SCHEDULER_TOKEN>

{ "key": "wake:6f0c…", "at": "2026-01-01T09:00:00.000Z", "atMs": 1767258000000 }
```

```http
DELETE <GRAM_SCHEDULER_URL>/timers/<key>
```

`PUT` replaces whatever the key held, and `DELETE` of a key the scheduler doesn't hold may answer
`404`. Keys are `wake:<id>`, `workspace-wake:<id>`, `snooze:<thread>` and
`routine:<workspace>:<routine>`, percent-encoded in the path. Redirects are not followed.

When a timer's time comes, the scheduler calls the server:

```http
POST /embed/v1/timers/fire
Authorization: Bearer <GRAM_EMBED_TOKEN>

{ "key": "wake:6f0c…" }
```

The answer is `{ "fired": true }`, or `{ "fired": false }` when nothing waits on that key: the wait
was cancelled or has fired already, and the scheduler drops it. `GET /embed/v1/timers` lists what
is waiting now, as `{ "timers": [{ "key", "at", "atMs" }] }`, for a scheduler that wants to check
its copy.

What to rely on:

- **The server's store stays the record.** What is due, and for whom, is decided by the server from
  its own database. A call for a time that hasn't come by the server's clock is waited out, not
  obeyed, so a scheduler can't fire a wake early.
- **A restart re-registers.** A server that starts arms every stored wait again: whatever fell due
  while it was down fires at once, and the rest are registered again with `PUT`. Start the server
  before calling `fire`, or call again when it answers.
- **A scheduler that is down delays, and loses nothing.** A registration that fails is retried
  every 30 seconds while the server runs, and a wait whose call never comes ends by itself
  30 seconds after its time.
- A routine that watches for events registers each of its looks, a few minutes apart, so such a
  routine keeps waking a server that would otherwise idle.

## Settings supplied from outside

The deployment can set some of the settings for this server. A supplied setting reads as supplied to everything inside, and nothing inside can change it: the Settings page, a paired phone and an agent's `settings_propose` are each refused, with a message that says the service that runs this Gram set it.

```
PUT /embed/v1/settings
{ "settings": { "logLevel": "info", "updates": { "channel": "stable" } } }
→ { "supplied": ["logLevel", "updates.channel"] }

GET /embed/v1/settings
→ { "settings": { "logLevel": "info", "updates": { "channel": "stable" } } }
```

- The body is a settings patch, the shape the app's own saves have: a section's fields, or a top-level key. `null` for an optional field keeps it cleared.
- Each `PUT` replaces everything supplied before. `{ "settings": {} }` supplies nothing, and `GET` then answers `null`.
- The answer lists what was taken. A setting this build doesn't know is left out of it rather than refused, so a deployment can tell which of its settings are in force.
- What is supplied is kept in the server's database and holds through a restart. It is applied only while the hosted features are on.
- A setting that is no longer supplied keeps the value it last had, and can be changed inside again.
- `experimental.embedding` can't be supplied: it is what turns this on (`GRAM_EMBEDDING`).

The Settings page doesn't yet mark a supplied setting: a change to one fails with the message above.
