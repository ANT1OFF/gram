## 1.0.0

Gram's first release: a desktop app for developers who run their own installed Claude Code and
Codex CLIs on their own subscriptions.

* **Your own agents.** Gram runs the Claude Code and Codex command-line tools you install, signed
  in with your own subscription. It has no account of its own and sends no telemetry.
* **Workspaces that plan and delegate.** Pick one or more repositories and say what to work on. An
  orchestrator plans the work and starts workers, each on its own branch in a git worktree.
* **Autonomy you choose.** Supervised, Publish or Full decides what agents may do without asking:
  pushing, opening pull requests, merging.
* **Needs you.** Questions, approvals and waits from every workspace collect in one place.
* **The Board.** A workspace's threads and pull requests, with their checks, reviews and merge
  readiness, read through the GitHub CLI.
* **Usage.** Your five-hour and weekly Claude and Codex limits, read from the installed tools.
* **Signed macOS builds** for Apple silicon that update in place from this repository's releases
  when you ask them to.
